## Turbulence spectrum

The code calculates the turbulence structure function of a fluid simulation.


## Limitations
- Currently the code can only handle Cartesian coordinates    
- The code assumes that the simulations are done using the PLUTO fluid code, 
  together with the pyPLUTO plotting tools.
